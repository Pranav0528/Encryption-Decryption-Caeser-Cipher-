Title: Caesar Cipher Python Script

Description
This Python script implements a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. The script provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar cipher.

Features
Encryption and decryption of messages
User input for cipher direction (encode or decode), message, and shift amount
Wrap-around functionality for shifts that go beyond the alphabet boundaries
Art module integration for a stylish logo display
Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the desired cipher direction (encode or decode).
Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Specify the shift amount (an integer between 0 and 25).
View the result and decide whether to continue or exit.
Dependencies
The script uses the art module for displaying a logo.
How to Run
Install the required dependencies: pip install art
Run the script: python caesar_cipher.py
